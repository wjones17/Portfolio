        <h2>Building and Flying FPV Drones</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past few years, I have mastered the art of building and flying FPV (First-Person-View) drones. These drones allow you to experience flight from the drone's perspective through a pair of video goggles. The sensation is exhilarating, and the drones can reach impressive speeds, depending on personal modifications. 
          For those interested in building their own FPV drones, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.getfpv.com/" target="_blank">getFPV.com</a>. This site provides a wealth of resources and components for building drones, including ready-to-fly options. Another valuable resource is "MR. Steele," a renowned figure in the FPV community, known for his exceptional flying skills. Below is a video of him in action:

        <h2>Woodburning and Carving</h2>
        <p>
          I have been passionate about woodburning since I was around 11 years old. The image below shows a recent piece I created for my son, featuring his name "Jax" with a scenic background. The glossy finish is due to a coat of polyurethane that protects the wood and enhances the artwork's details.
