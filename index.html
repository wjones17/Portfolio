        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I am proficient in Object-Oriented Programming with advanced skills in Java and foundational knowledge in Python. My technical expertise extends to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Vue framework, gained through my Intro to Web Development class.
          I am self-motivated and dedicated to continuous personal and professional growth. Known for my integrity and accountability, I take ownership of my decisions and mistakes. My excellent communication skills allow me to effectively ask questions and share information.
          I am adaptable, open-minded, and approach challenges with a positive attitude. Demonstrating leadership in high-pressure situations, I am always eager to learn and embrace new opportunities.
